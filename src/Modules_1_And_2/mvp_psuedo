-------MVP---------
The user will start the program, which defaults to a screen with two h2 elements: 'Good Design' & 'Poor Design'. If they select Good Design,
they will be shown an elevator panel with buttons and labels that properly follow the principles of Archetypes, Consistency, Alignment, and
Fitt's Law. They have the option to either go back to the first screen, or click on 'Poor Design'. If they click 'Poor Design', they will
be shown an elevator panel that violates all of the above principles.

Good Design:
    Archetypes: Buttons are round, and the labels are not. 
    Consistency: Buttons and Labels don't deviate from a visual pattern.
    Alignment: Numbers and words are centered within the buttons
    Fitt's Law: Ground Floor button is biggest and has details, open/close buttons are slightly bigger than floor buttons

Bad Design:
    Archetypes: Buttons are round like bullet points with numbers inside them, labels are also round with numbers inside them.
    Consistency: Buttons are given a random margin.
    Alignment: All numbers and words will be slightly off center.
    Fitt's Law: Each button is a random size, except for the ground floor and open/close door buttons, which are small and poorly labeled.


STRETCH GOALS: 
    I will program the elevator to work.
    I will add sound effects.
